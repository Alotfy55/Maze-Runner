# Maze-Runner
Maze Solver using graph theory made by C++

## Description
Console application that reads a maze from a .txt file then solve it using different graph algorithm **DFS, BFS, A-star and Dijkstra** then show the difference in performance between them and the chosen path by each algorithm. Maze generation is also used to generate a maze using the desired length and width which was made using **DFS** which gurantees at least a route between any points in the maze. A fun part is also included where you are allowed to solve the maze yourself **aka using your brain**.
